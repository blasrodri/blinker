# M0 Findings

What building the workload recorder actually taught us, recorded against the
assumptions in [PRODUCT_SPEC.md](PRODUCT_SPEC.md). The point of Milestone 0 is
to replace guesses about rustc's behaviour with observations, so the findings
that *contradict* the spec are the valuable output.

Environment these were observed on:

```
macOS 26.5.2 (25F84), Apple Silicon (arm64)
Xcode 26.6 (17F113), macOS SDK 26.5
rustc 1.97.1 (8bab26f4f 2026-07-14), LLVM 22.1.6
cargo 1.97.1 (c980f4866 2026-06-30)
```

## 1. rustc invokes `cc`, not `ld` — the spec's argument model was wrong

**Spec assumption.** §10 and §38 describe parsing `ld64` options and delegating
to `/usr/bin/ld`, with §30's example showing `--fallback-linker /usr/bin/ld`.

**Observed.** `rustc` does not invoke `ld` at all. It invokes the *C compiler
driver* and lets the driver call `ld64`. The `linker = …` key in
`.cargo/config.toml` names a program in the **cc driver** position. A minimal
`cargo build` for `aarch64-apple-darwin` produced 37 arguments:

```
<symbols.o> <7 × *.rcgu.o> <20 × *.rlib>
-lSystem -lc -lm
-arch arm64
-mmacosx-version-min=11.0.0
-o <output>
-Wl,-dead_strip
-nodefaultlibs
```

Note `-arch arm64` (not `-arch_multiple`/`ld64` spelling),
`-mmacosx-version-min=` (a driver flag; `ld64` spells it `-platform_version`),
and `-Wl,-dead_strip` — the only real `ld64` option present, tunnelled through
the driver's `-Wl,` mechanism.

**Consequences, applied.**

- The `arguments` crate parses the **driver** surface and splits `-Wl,a,b`
  payloads into individual `ld64` options.
- The default fallback is `/usr/bin/cc`, not `/usr/bin/ld`. Forwarding this
  vector to `ld` would fail immediately — it does not accept these spellings.
- Every blinker option uses a `--blinker-` prefix. §38 raised namespacing as a
  contingency ("if collisions with `ld64` options become possible"); with the
  driver surface the collision risk is immediate, not hypothetical.

**Open question for M2.** When blinker starts linking internally it must decide
whether to *emulate the driver* (interpreting `-arch`, `-mmacosx-version-min=`,
`-lSystem`, and driver-injected default libraries itself) or to *become* an
`ld64` replacement invoked by a driver. These are materially different scopes.
The recorded corpus should settle which arguments must be interpreted before
that decision is made.

## 2. Recorded invocations are not replayable without archiving inputs

**Spec assumption.** §36 M0 acceptance: "Recorded invocations can be replayed."
§41 item 11: "Supports replaying a recorded invocation." Both read as though
recording the argument vector is sufficient.

**Observed.** It is not. `rustc` writes the link's object files — `symbols.o`
and one `.rcgu.o` per codegen unit — into a temporary directory
(`target/…/deps/rustc<random>/`) that it **deletes as soon as the linker
returns**. Replaying a recorded argument vector even seconds later fails:

```
clang: error: no such file or directory: '…/deps/rustcvrSigF/symbols.o'
```

This was found by writing the replay test, not by reading the spec.

**Consequence, applied.** Recording now snapshots every input file next to the
JSON record, and stores a second `replay_argv` pointing at the archived copies.
Replay prefers `replay_argv` and redirects `-o` into a scratch directory so it
can never overwrite a real build artifact.

**Cost.** Archiving copies the full input set, including ~20 rlibs (libstd and
friends). Recording is opt-in per invocation, so this is only paid when building
a corpus — but a corpus of several projects will be hundreds of MB. If that
becomes a problem, content-addressed dedup across recordings is the obvious fix
(the rlibs are identical across every link against the same toolchain), and M4's
cache will need content addressing anyway.

## 3. Response files do not appear at small scale

**Spec assumption.** §41 item 3 lists safe response-file expansion as an M0
deliverable, implying they are routinely present.

**Observed.** A minimal build passed all 37 arguments directly; no `@file`
appeared. Response files are an argument-length-limit mitigation and only show
up once the input set is large.

**Consequence.** Expansion is implemented and unit-tested anyway (nested files,
cycles, quoting, escapes) because a workspace of real size will use them — but
the *integration* fixtures do not currently exercise that path. The large
fixture that M4 benchmarking needs should be checked for response-file use, and
if it triggers them, an end-to-end test should cover it. Until then, response
file handling is unit-tested only, and that gap is deliberate rather than
overlooked.

---

## 4. Argument classification is complete for the observed corpus

All arguments in the observed invocations classify without falling through to
`Unrecognized`. An integration test asserts this and is designed to fail loudly
as the corpus grows:

```
rustc emitted arguments blinker does not model: [...]
This is expected to happen as the corpus grows — add them to the
`arguments` crate's classifier rather than relaxing this assertion.
```

**Caveat on breadth.** The current corpus is narrow: single-crate binaries with
no build scripts, no C dependencies, no proc macros, no framework linkage, and
no `cargo test` harness. The classifier being complete says little until the
corpus covers those. Expanding it is the first task remaining in M0.

## 5. Anything the linker prints makes rustc emit a warning

**Spec assumption.** §7 shows a concise human-readable summary printed on every
link ("mode: incremental / elapsed: 82 ms / …"), with §31's `--print-stats`
controlling it.

**Observed.** rustc has a `linker_messages` lint, on by default. Any linker
output on stdout or stderr surfaces as a build warning:

```
warning: linker stderr output
  = note: `#[warn(linker_messages)]` on by default
warning: `probe` (bin "probe") generated 1 warning
```

So a summary printed on every successful link would add a warning to every
successful build — exactly the noise §7 says to avoid ("normal successful links
should not generate excessive output").

**Consequence.** The machine-readable record is the primary interface, not the
terminal. `--blinker-json-diagnostics` and `--blinker-record-invocation` are
side channels that produce no build warnings. `--blinker-print-stats` remains
available but is opt-in and inherently noisy under cargo.

**Open question.** A per-link human-readable summary that does *not* warn needs
a channel other than the linker's stdio — a file the user tails, or the eventual
daemon (§28). Worth settling before M4, since that is the milestone whose
results a developer will actually want to watch.

## Remaining M0 work

The scaffolding, recorder, and harness are done and the gate is green
(90 tests). Not yet done:

1. **Corpus breadth.** Run the recorder over ≥5 representative real projects —
   including a build-script crate, a C dependency, a proc-macro user, and a
   `cargo test --no-run` harness binary — and inventory whatever new arguments
   appear. This is the actual M0 acceptance bar and the input to M1's scope.
2. **Baseline timing report.** Record system-linker latency across those
   projects, so every later performance claim has a same-machine baseline to
   compare against. blinker already measures and records the delegation time; it
   needs to be run over real workloads and written up.

## Decisions taken during M0

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Hand-rolled option parsing, no `clap` | Options must be scanned out of a foreign, driver-shaped argv and stripped in place; `clap` models a vector it owns. Also keeps the dependency set at 3. |
| `--blinker-` prefix for all project options | Collision with driver/`ld64` flags is immediate, not hypothetical (finding 1). |
| Fallback defaults to `cc`, then `clang` | Matches what rustc would have invoked (finding 1). |
| Explicit missing fallback path is an error | Silently substituting a different linker would change link semantics without saying so. |
| Logic in `blinker_cli` lib, thin `main.rs` | Lets the driver be tested directly rather than only through process spawning. |
| JSON key set is fixed; unpopulated fields are `null` | Consumers index these directly; a stable key set means no defensive guards, and a test asserts the contract. |
| Fingerprint fast path only (no hashing by default) | Spec §13's verification-path *policy* belongs to M4, where reuse decisions actually depend on it. The recorded shape already carries the fields M4 will need. |
